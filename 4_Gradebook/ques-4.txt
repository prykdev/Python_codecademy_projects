Python Gradebook
You are a student and you are trying to organize your subjects and grades using Python. Let’s explore what we’ve learned about lists to organize your subjects and scores.

Create Some Lists:
1.
Create a list called subjects and fill it with the classes you are taking:

"physics"
"calculus"
"poetry"
"history"

    
2.
Create a list called grades and fill it with your scores:

98
97
85
88

    
3.
Use the zip() function to combine subjects and grades.

Save this zip object as a list into a variable called gradebook.


    
4.
Print gradebook.

Does it look how you expected it would?


    
Add More Subjects:
5.
Your grade for Computer Science class just came in! You got a perfect score, 100!

After your definitions of subjects and grades but before you create gradebook, use append to add "computer science" to subjects and 100 to grades.


    
6.
Your grade for visual arts just came in! You got a 93!

After the creation of gradebook (but before you print it out), use append to add ("visual arts", 93) to gradebook.


    
One Big Gradebook!
7.
You also have your grades from last semester, stored in last_semester_gradebook. Create a new variable full_gradebook with the items from both gradebook and last_semester_gradebook.
